## Description

Finally i got my first flag on crypto! But I accidentally dropped it and it shattered into pieces. When I collected all of the pieces, the pieces seemed to be 'corrupt'. Can you help me recover the flag? If you found the flag, put it back inside the flag prefix (`GRF24{...}`)`

## Hint

- Try to look the title
- There are many types of encoding
