## Description

As a skilled cyber security person, you somehow can get source code of ransomware and the encrypted data too. You want to recover all data that has been encrypted. So you try to reverse the ransomware. After all, this is the goofies ransomware ever, because the key was already inside the ransomware.

## Hint
